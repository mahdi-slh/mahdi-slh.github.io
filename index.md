## About Me

Hello! I'm Mahdi (also Mehdi) Saleh, a research scientist specializing in 3D computer vision at TUM, supervised by Federico Tombari and Nassir Navab. Currently, I am a research intern at Meta Reality Labs in Seattle, Washington. My research areas include 3D Object Pose, Hierarchical Representation, and Graph Neural Networks. I hold a Master's degree in Biomedical Computing from TUM and a Bachelor's in Electrical Control Engineering from IUST. In my leisure time, I enjoy computer graphics and design, web development, and game design.
